# GigaChat project [in development]
GigaChat project is an open-source free social platform, written in native code for each supported operating system. The idea behind the project is combining the most useful features of all the most popular messangers/social networks (e.g. Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram) while keeping off their disadvantages. While it is highly unlikely someone would be interested in a school project, we welcome any sort of help!
